# FixtureBuilder
A basic test fixture builder.

I coded it as an academic exercise, wanting to get a better understanding of the nuances of reflection and .NET types.

I did not code it as a replacement for AutoFixture. It's nowhere near as sophisticated. But I will be using it in my own projects whilst waiting for AutoFixture to be ported across to .NET Core.
